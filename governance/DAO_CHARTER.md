# DAO Charter (Contribution-Only)

**Contract address (reference only):** see `CONTRACT_ADDRESS.txt`

## Purpose
This DAO is a **contribution and documentation governance layer** for the canon and its supporting infrastructure.

## Non-Investment Framing
- This repository and governance process do **not** solicit investment.
- No promises of profit, ROI, dividends, or appreciation.
- Participation is framed as contribution, review, stewardship, and public documentation.

## Governance Objects
- Proposals (work items / changes / releases)
- Reviews (quality + provenance checks)
- Merges (accepted contributions)
- Attestations (who contributed what)

## Decision Standard
Default tiebreaker: **Mirror → Water → Fire** (see `canon/DOCTRINE.md`).

## Required Records
- `GOVERNANCE_INDEX.json`
- `ATTESTATION_LOG.md`
- Proposal folders under `governance/proposals/`
