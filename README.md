# Goldstonian Visibility Engine (GVE)

The Goldstonian Visibility Engine is an in-house, reproducible system for **authority, indexation, provenance, and distribution** across:
- Canon (doctrine + interpretive rules + glossary)
- Agent-readable exports (claims, citations, prompts, schemas)
- Media pipelines (YouTube, Rumble, Substack, LinkedIn, X)
- Institutional gravity (DOIs + citations + research indexing)
- Contribution-only governance (no investment framing)

## Contract Address (reference only)
See `CONTRACT_ADDRESS.txt` for the canonical string.

## Core Idea
Visibility is not marketing. Visibility is **indexation + authority + narrative control**.

## Start Here
1. `canon/CANON_INDEX.json` (source of truth)
2. `engine/ENGINE_OVERVIEW.md` (how the flywheel works)
3. `index/exports/` (agent-ready dumps)
4. `governance/DAO_CHARTER.md` (contribution-only)
5. `doi/DOI_HOOKS.md` (DOI wiring)

## Canon Release Flow
- Update canon docs + schemas
- Generate exports (index/exports)
- Tag a GitHub release
- Mint DOI via Zenodo integration
- Publish media batches linking: Repo + DOI + Canon version

## Safety + Compliance Positioning
This repository provides a **contribution and documentation framework**. It does not offer financial advice, investment solicitation, or ROI claims.
