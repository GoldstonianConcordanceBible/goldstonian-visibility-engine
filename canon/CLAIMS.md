# Canon Claims (Seed List)

Each claim should be moved into `index/exports/claims.export.json` as structured data.

1. The canon must be versioned and exportable for AI agents.
2. Provenance (citations + commits + DOIs) is the basis of durable authority.
3. Governance is contribution-only: proposals, reviews, merges, attestations.
4. Media output must link back to canonical artifacts (repo + DOI + canon version).
