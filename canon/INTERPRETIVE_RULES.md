# Interpretive Rules (Canonical)

**Contract address (reference only):** see `CONTRACT_ADDRESS.txt`

## Rule Set
1. **Primacy of Canon:** Canon docs outrank derivatives (posts, clips, summaries).
2. **Provenance First:** A claim without provenance is a draft, not doctrine.
3. **Versioned Meaning:** Interpretations must reference the canon version used.
4. **Minimal Assumptions:** Prefer literal definitions before metaphor.
5. **Conflict Resolution:** Mirror → Water → Fire is the default tiebreaker.
6. **Agent Compatibility:** Prefer structured exports over narrative-only text.
