# GCB Doctrine (Canonical)

Contract Address (pump.fun):

## Purpose
The doctrine defines the tiebreak authority and meaning-stability rules that govern all GCB outputs.
It is intended to be operational for both humans and AI agents.

## Tiebreak Authority
When multiple interpretations compete, the final authority is:

**Mirror → Water → Fire**

### Mirror
Reflect the plain meaning and immediate context without embellishment.
- state what is said
- do not add motive
- do not add imagined detail
- distinguish observation vs interpretation

### Water
Compare across witnesses (cross-references, concordance patterns, consistent definitions).
- maintain stable definitions
- align terminology with glossary
- test interpretations against multiple occurrences/examples

### Fire
Refine through test: coherence, accountability, auditability, and fruit.
- reasoning must be reviewable after the fact
- claims must be traceable to evidence
- outputs should withstand critique without collapsing into vagueness

## Non-negotiables
1. **Traceability:** factual claims must be evidence-backed and cite sources.
2. **Definition stability:** glossary terms control meaning; do not redefine silently.
3. **Provenance:** forks must retain canonical attribution files.
4. **Safety:** no content that violates canonical safety guardrails.
5. **Non-investment framing:** token references never promise ROI or profit.

## Canon is a contract of consistency
The canon is not “content only.” It is a behavioral standard for agents:
- how they define terms
- how they cite
- how they reason under conflict
- how they preserve provenance

## When to propose change
Use governance proposals when:
- definitions need to be added/updated
- interpretive rules need refinement
- new schemas are required
- safety guardrails must be extended

Canonical process:
Proposal → Review → Attestation → Release tagging (if applicable)
