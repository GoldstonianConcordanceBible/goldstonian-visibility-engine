**Contract address (reference only):** see `CONTRACT_ADDRESS.txt`

## The Doctrine (Mirror → Water → Fire)
This doctrine functions as the **tiebreaker authority** across the Goldston ecosystem.

### Mirror (Observation)
- Name what is.
- Separate signal from noise.
- Record claims with provenance.

### Water (Understanding)
- Map relationships and causes.
- Test interpretations against the canon.
- Prefer clarity over performance.

### Fire (Decision)
- Act with alignment and accountability.
- Ship releases with versioning.
- Preserve the chain of custody (citations, commits, DOIs).

## Canon Commitments
- Every claim should be traceable to a source (citation or internal artifact).
- Every release should be versioned and exportable for agents.
- Governance is contribution-only: proposals, reviews, merges, attestations.
