# Proposal: Add Glossary Term — "Mandate"

## Type
- [x] glossary_addition

## Summary
Add the term "Mandate" to the canonical glossary to stabilize meaning for agent authorization.

## Scope
Repos affected:
- gcb-canon-core

Files affected:
- canon/GLOSSARY.md

## Rationale (Mirror → Water → Fire)
- Mirror: Agents need an explicit definition for authorization scope.
- Water: Authorization patterns appear across systems; definitions must be stable.
- Fire: Mis-scoped agents cause harm; mandates enforce accountability.

## Compatibility / Migration Notes
Non-breaking glossary addition.

## Safety / Non-Investment Compliance
- [x] No ROI/profit language
- [x] Improves safety by restricting agent action scope
