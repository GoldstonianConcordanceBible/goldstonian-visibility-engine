# GCB Contribution-Only DAO Charter (Canonical Governance)

Contract Address (pump.fun):
E68E27Y72FHTJH1MycB6KjX5PQAyKPYsRGZjMEx9pump

## 1) Purpose
This governance system exists to maintain:
- Canon: doctrine, interpretive rules, glossary, safety guardrails
- Spec: schemas, examples, validation rules
- Research indexing: DOI-ready metadata, citation normalization
- Agent reference implementations: reusable tools and output contracts

## 2) Non-Investment Statement (Required)
This is a contribution and documentation system.
No profit claims, no ROI language, no solicitation, no securities framing.

## 3) Guiding Principle
**Work is the unit of trust.**
Participation is recognized through contributions, reviews, and attestations.

## 4) Canon Authority
The canonical authority is maintained in `gcb-canon-core`.
All proposals must align with Mirror → Water → Fire.

## 5) Membership
Membership is earned through open-source contributions:
- merged pull requests
- peer review
- issue triage
- documentation improvements
- schema development
- research indexing entries

Membership confers no financial rights.

## 6) Change Types
- Canon change (highest impact)
- Schema/spec change
- Glossary addition/change
- Documentation/tooling
- Metadata/DOI processes

## 7) Attestations (Mandatory for Canon/Spec)
Any of the following require attestations:
- canon changes
- schema/spec changes
- glossary meaning changes

At minimum: one author attestation.
Recommended: one reviewer attestation.

## 8) Release Discipline
If canon/spec meaning changes:
- bump version
- tag release
- update changelog/deprecations
- link proposal + attestations

## 9) Enforcement
Maintainers can block merges that:
- break schemas without version bump
- remove provenance files
- introduce ROI/profit framing
- violate safety guardrails
